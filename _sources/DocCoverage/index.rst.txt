Documentation Coverage
######################

Documentation coverage measures the presence of code documentation. It primarily counts for public language entities
like publicly visible constants and variables, parameters, types, functions, methods, classes, modules, packages, etc.
The documentation goal depends on the used coverage collection tool's settings. E.g. usually, private language entities
are not required to be documented.

The documentation coverage metric in percent is a ratio of documented language entity versus all documentation worthy
langauge entities. A coverage of <100% indicates undocumented code.

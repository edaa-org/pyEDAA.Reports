Code Coverage
#############

Code coverage measures used and unused code lines, statements, branches, etc. Depending on the programming language this
is measured by instrumenting the code/binary and running the program, it's test cases or simulating the code. In
generate code coverage is a measure of test coverage. Unused code is not (yet) covered by tests.

The code coverage metric in percent is a ratio of used code versus all possibly usable code. A coverage of <100%
indicates unused code. This can be dead code (unreachable) or untested code (â‡’ needs more test cases).
